</h3>
<p>Over the past five years, renting an apartment in Peterborough has
become dramatically less affordable. Falling turnover rates (the lowest
in the province as of 2023) tell us that more tenants are staying put to
preserve their rent control protections. This trend indicates that the
rent increases documented in the Rental Market Report (and examined
here) understate the market changes experienced by tenants moving to and
within Peterborough. Though prices have increased, low vacancy rates
suggests that demand has grown faster than supply, that rents will
continue rising, and that—without intervention remaining housed in
Peterborough will continue to become less affordable over time.</p>
